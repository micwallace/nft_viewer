## NFT Token Viewer

This project is a simple NFT token viewer. 

When connected to a Metamask wallet, NFTs are retrieved via Opensea API and displayed in a formation of your choosing. 
This is based off the three.js example [here](https://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html) and has been integrated with React.
